# To-Do List

A simple HTML-based to-do list application with add, edit, and delete functionality for managing tasks.

## Pros
- Clean, responsive layout using flexbox for task management
- Zero dependencies; works in all modern browsers without external libraries
- Basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Edit, Delete) with intuitive UI
- Beginner-friendly code structure for learning DOM manipulation and event handling
- Dynamic task creation with immediate user feedback
- Clear visual separation between task items and controls

## Cons
- No persistent storage (tasks lost on page refresh)
- Edit functionality uses browser prompt (not inline editing for better UX)
- No task completion status or checkboxes for marking tasks as done
- No sorting/filtering options for task organization
- No validation for task input beyond empty check (e.g., no length limits)
- No visual distinction between active/completed tasks
- Delete/edit buttons lack hover/focus states for accessibility

## Takeaways
- Perfect starting point for learning frontend development fundamentals
- Easy to enhance with features like:
  - Local storage integration to save tasks between sessions
  - Inline editing instead of prompt-based input
  - Checkboxes to mark tasks as completed with strikethrough styling
  - Sorting by date or priority
  - Task filtering (e.g., show all, active, completed)
  - Responsive design improvements for mobile devices
  - Drag-and-drop reordering functionality
- Ideal foundation for building professional task management applications
